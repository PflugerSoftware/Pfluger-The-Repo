## Pattern Analysis

### 1. Training Before Bad News
- July-August: Trained leaders on feedback and check-ins
- Framed as "employee engagement survey response"
- Actually: Prepping leaders to have difficult conversations

### 2. Shifting Deadlines
- Goals moved from Dec 31 → Sept 30
- Annual reviews pushed from October → Q1
- Suggests organizational uncertainty and changing priorities

### 3. The November Meeting
Agenda items that stand out:
- "2025 Challenges & Opportunities"
- "Team Structure to Deliver Results"
- "2025 & 2026 Compensation"

"Team Structure" is often code for reorganization/layoffs.

### 4. Leaders Asking for Scripts (12/2)
Multiple People Leaders simultaneously asking for:
- "Scripted agenda of what we can say"
- "Answers to FAQs"
- "Specific line items we can discuss"

This is a tell - they're nervous about what they have to deliver.

### 5. Rush to Deliver Before Holidays
- Comp letters sent 12/15
- Deadline to meet with all staff: 12/19
- Squeeze difficult conversations into 4 days before holiday break

## Context

This aligns with known firm financials:
- Revenue decline: $75M (2024) → ~$50M (2025)
- OT cut firm-wide
- Research hours suppressed (726 actual vs 2,000 planned)
- "Every hour needs to be billable" mentality

## Key People in Chat

| Person | Role |
|--------|------|
| Lauren Paver | COO / co-CEO |
| Dina Mavridis | P&C (HR lead) |
| Sophia Condon | P&C |
| Claire Powers | Admin (Terry's assistant) |
| Chad Martin | Architect Director |
| Kent Brittain | People Leader |
| William Webb | People Leader |
| Edward Rodriguez | People Leader |

## Bottom Line

The chat reads like HR systematically preparing leadership to deliver bad news:
1. Train them on "feedback" (soft skills cover)
2. Push reviews when things get complicated
3. Closed-door meeting on "challenges" and "structure"
4. Scripts requested by nervous leaders
5. Rush delivery before holidays

The "scripted talking points" request from multiple leaders on the same day (12/2) is the clearest signal that something significant was coming.
