# Midland Furniture Pilot Survey Analysis

## Executive Summary (Meeting 2/3)

**321 students and 7 teachers** surveyed across 4 campuses. **93% positive first impressions.**

> **DATA NOTE:** The student survey *{1}* had a typo where "Desk 3" was listed twice instead of "Desk 3" and "Desk 4" as separate options. This affected three questions: Q10 (favorite desk), Q12 (enough space to work), and Q14 (easiest to move). As a result, all student "Desk 3" numbers below are actually Desk 3 + Desk 4 combined. Desk 1 and Desk 2 numbers are unaffected. The teacher survey *{3}* correctly listed all four desks, so teacher desk data is clean.

### Headlines
- **Chair 3** (46.6%) is the clear student chair favorite, chosen for SIZE, not comfort (lowest comfort rating at 90%) *{2}*
- **Desk 3/4 combined** (52.7%) preferred over Desk 1 (30.0%) and Desk 2 (17.3%), see DATA NOTE *{2}*
- **93% positive first impression** from students *{2}*
- **Teachers prefer 2 casters** and do most of the rearranging (4 of 5), so their mobility preferences should take priority *{4}*

### Design Recommendations
1. **Size matters most** - 45% of students prioritize workspace size *{2}*
2. **2 casters preferred** - middle ground between mobile and stable (per teachers) *{4}*
3. **Consider height adjustability** - 10% of students mention height issues *{2}*
4. **Darker/more durable laminate** - reduce pencil transfer marks *{2}{4}*
5. **Keep the hook** - Chair 1's backpack hook is valued by 20% of its fans *{2}*

**93% positive or curious** about the new furniture.

---

### Chair Preferences *{2}*

| Chair | Count | % |
|-------|-------|---|
| **Chair 3** | 130 | 46.6% |
| Chair 1 | 56 | 20.1% |
| Chair 4 | 48 | 17.2% |
| Chair 2 | 45 | 16.1% |

#### Comfort Ratings (By Chair)

| Chair | Popularity | % Comfortable | Can Sit Most/All |
|-------|------------|---------------|------------------|
| Chair 1 | 20.1% | **96.4%** | 91.1% |
| Chair 2 | 16.1% | 93.3% | **97.8%** |
| **Chair 3** | **46.6%** | 90.0% | 89.2% |
| Chair 4 | 17.2% | 93.8% | 87.5% |

**Key insight: Chair 3 is most popular but has the lowest comfort rating.** Students are choosing it for other reasons (size, not connected to desk, spacious) rather than pure comfort.

Overall across all chairs: 92.5% comfortable, 90.7% can sit most/all of class.

#### What Makes Each Chair Unique

| Chair | Differentiator | % Mentioning | Key Quote |
|-------|----------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Chair 1** | Hook/backpack storage | 20% | "It has a hook and is comfortable" |
| **Chair 2** | No hole in seat | 11% | "it doesn't have a hole in the bottom" |
| **Chair 3** | Big/Wide/Spacious | 29% | "because it is wide and also big for a person" |
| **Chair 4** | Lightweight/mobile | 13% | "I like being able to move my chair and not having it stuck" |

**Chair 1's hook** is a unique feature - 20% of Chair 1 fans mention being able to hang backpacks.

**Chair 2's "no hole"** - multiple students specifically mention they don't like the gap/hole in other chair seats ("so my ahh is showing").

#### Why Students Like Their Chair (Qualitative Themes)

From 268 responses with content:

| Theme | Mentions | % |
|-------|----------|---|
| **Comfort** | 137 | 51.1% |
| Size/Space | 48 | 17.9% |
| Mobility | 21 | 7.8% |
| Height | 7 | 2.6% |

**Sample Quotes:**
- Comfort: "because it was the most comfortable out of the rest of them" (Student #3, Midland Freshman)
- Size: "because it is wide and also big for a person" (Student #1, Midland Freshman)
- Mobility: "I like being able to move my chair and not having it stuck" (Student #2, Midland Freshman)
- Not Connected: "because its not connected to a desk and its comfortable" (Student #23, Midland Freshman)

### Desk Preferences *{2}*

| Desk | Count | % |
|------|-------|---|
| **Desk 3/4*** | 146 | 52.7% |
| Desk 1 | 83 | 30.0% |
| Desk 2 | 48 | 17.3% |

*Due to a survey typo, Desk 3 and Desk 4 were both listed as "Desk 3." These votes are combined and cannot be separated. However, qualitative analysis of why students picked "Desk 3" reveals two distinct theme clusters:

**Size/Space cluster (~48 responses, 35%):** Students describe a big, spacious desk with room to work.
- "it gives me more room to work on, like if I'm doing a poster I can put my whole poster on it" (V19)
- "very spacious" (V39, V42, V46, V50, V65)

**Mobility/Wheels cluster (~23 responses, 17%):** Students describe ease of movement and locking wheels.
- "the wheels are lockable, they will not move around" (V244)
- "it has wheels so you can move it wherever you want" (V234)
- "it's easy to move around for group work" (V113)

These clusters may represent the two different desks. Some students even describe conflicting physical features: "grey with 2 wheels in the front" (V247) vs "4 wheels" (V71, V290), and "small and easy to work on" (V141) vs "big and spacious" (V1).

#### Desk Complaints (Qualitative Themes)

From 197 complaints with content:

| Theme | Mentions | % |
|-------|----------|---|
| **Size/Space** | 49 | 24.9% |
| **Mobility/Casters** | 48 | 24.4% |
| Comfort | 18 | 9.1% |
| Height | 15 | 7.6% |
| Durability | 8 | 4.1% |
| Surface Transfer | 4 | 2.0% |

**Sample Quotes:**
- Size: "they need to be bigger" (Student #4, Midland Freshman)
- Mobility: "it moves easily bc of the wheels on every side of it" (Student #14, Midland Freshman)
- Height: "they are too tall for the short people" (Student #3, Midland Freshman)
- Surface: "Some of them transfer" (Student #50, Lee HS) / "leave transfer marks from our pencils" (Student #60, Lee HS)
- Durability: "Some of the desks can be off balanced" (Student #15, Midland Freshman)

### Student Desk Complaints (From Teachers) *{4}*

- "One set is too big and another transfers pencil very easily through paper" (T2)
- "Some of the others are way too big and stick out on the sides" (T3)
- "So many casters means it makes it hard to actually move the desks around" (T5)
- "Some desks don't have locking wheels and they move too easily" (T7)

---

### Teacher Desk & Mobile Table *{4}*

Teachers were asked about two separate pieces:

#### Teacher Desk (Main/Stationary)

| Teacher | Enough Space? | Redesign Wish |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| T2 | Yes | Want height adjustable |
| T3 | Yes | Shelves connected, pencil drawer |
| T5 | Yes | Slightly bigger |
| T6 | Yes | Nothing |
| T7 | No | Bigger - no space with desktop computer |

#### Mobile Table (Movable Piece)

| Teacher | How They Use It |
|---------|-----------------|
| T2 | "At the front for now" - not moving it (assembly issues, missing screws) |
| T3 | "Very bulky - use it in back to teach behind students" |
| T5 | "As a podium and movable group desk" - loves it |
| T6 | Moves around while teaching - laptop, materials, supplies |
| T7 | "Mostly fixed to one spot" - but likes flexibility for hallway use |

Usage splits into three patterns:

| Usage Pattern | Teachers | Description |
|---------------|----------|-------------|
| Active teaching tool | T5, T6 | Move it around, use as podium |
| Fixed station | T7 | Stays put, occasionally moved |
| Bulky/problematic | T2, T3 | Hard to maneuver, assembly issues |

> "It's very bulky... Smaller bottom piece to make it easier to maneuver" (T3)

**Bottom line:** The mobile table works great for some teachers (dynamic teaching tool) but is too bulky for others. Consider a lighter/smaller option.

## Additional Findings (To Investigate)

### Open Questions

- **Good vs Bad?** - Some comments need deeper investigation to determine if they're positive or negative feedback
- **Armrests** - There will be no armrests on the chairs (design decision)

### Classroom Size Context

Desk size complaints may not be an issue. Some teachers may be coming from larger or smaller classrooms.

**Suggestion for Furniture Rodeo:** Tape out the area of the new classrooms so teachers can see the accurate size in context with the furniture options.

### Unsolicited Topics Mentioned *{2}*

| Topic | Mentions | Examples |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Leg room | 42 | "Knees hitting desk", "leg space" |
| Hooks/backpack storage | 34 | "hook on the back for your backpack", "you can hang stuff on it without it tipping over" |
| Footrest/bar | 34 | "add foot rest", "bar in the middle is terrible" |

**Note:** Footrest/bar needs further investigation - mixed feedback.
